# Report  
**Lab: Natural Language to SQL**

## Overview  
This lab focused on converting **natural language questions into SQL queries**. The task was to analyze questions, understand the database schema, and generate correct SQL statements that return the expected results.

## Process  
- Reviewed the database schema (tables, columns, relationships).  
- Used prompt templates to guide query generation.  
- Wrote SQL queries based on natural language inputs.  
- Tested queries directly in the notebook to confirm correctness.

## Results  
- All queries executed successfully.  
- Queries returned the expected results with no syntax errors.  
- Examples include selecting customer and order details with proper date formatting and joins.

## Learnings  
- Clear understanding of how to translate natural language into SQL logic.  
- Reinforced knowledge of **JOINs, WHERE conditions, and date handling**.  
- Practiced debugging and validating queries against a schema.

## Deliverables  
- Final notebook with working queries.  
- This simple `report.md` summarizing the project.
